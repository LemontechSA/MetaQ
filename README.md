# MetaQ

MetaQ propagates the same query on multiple databases on the same engine

---

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

You can Tap this repository and install like this

```sh
brew tap lemontechsa/metaq
brew install metaq
```

### Binary Releases

Or, if you prefer, you can download Mac OS & Linux binaries [here](../../releases).

---

## TODO

### Config editing

Yeah, we don't have that yet, but you can manually edit them or delete them here `~/.metaq`

### PostgreSQL support

I know there's an option for it, but oh well... didn't have the time to implement it for this first release

### Manually choosing databases to execute queries

I really wanted to add this, but it was quicker to just have a filter for now
